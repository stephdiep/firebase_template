  Firebase 101 on Gatsby x React
</h1>

Create a Gatsby app with basic Firebase and no data in it.


1.  **Create the Firebase project**

     1. Go on https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/ and click on ``Add project``
     1. Add a name to your project, then click on ``Continue``
     1. Enable Google Analytics if you want to, then click on ``Continue``
     1. Your Firebase project has been created!


1. **Enable Firestore**

    1. Click on ``Cloud Firestore`` on the leftside menu
    1. Click on ``Create database``
    1. For developing purposes, select ``Start in test mode`` so you can write and read data however you want it. Remember to change it back when your website is in production.
    1. Press on ``Next`` and select the region you want. ``nam5 (us-central)`` is fine if you are in Eastern America.
    1. Then click on ``Enable`` when you are done.
    1. Firestore has now been enabled for your Firebase project!


1. **Add Firebase to your app**
    1. Go back to ``Project Overview``
    1. In the hero section, you can see ``Get started by adding Firebase to your app``
    1. Click on the type of application you are developing. If it's for web, click on ``Web``
    1. Register your app by adding an app nickname
    1. If you wish to host your app on Firebase, check the ``Also enable Firebase hosting for this app``
    1. When you are done, click on ``Register app``
    1. You'll then see your ``firebaseConfig`` keys. We'll come back to that later.
    1. Click on ``Continue to console``
    1. Your app has been registered!
 
 1. **
